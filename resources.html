<b>LaTeX Resources. </b>
All problem set answers must be typeset in LaTeX. LaTeX is the most widely used tool to professionally typeset mathematical content, proofs, conference and journal papers, etc.
It is installed on all CS lab machines (both OS X and Unix) and is freely available for all major operating systems, as well as in browser-based platforms such as <a href ="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>.
If you have not had experience with LaTeX in CSCI 256 or other courses, you may find the following resources helpful:

Note that you are allowed use online resources or AI tools to help debug your LaTeX code or typeset 
your figures in LaTeX.

LaTeX can be used on the command line
via the <code>pdflatex</code> command or, on the Macs, via the TeXShop application, which provides an integrated editor/compiler/pdf-viewer.
Converting a .tex file to a .pdf file in either of the above environments is refered to as "compiling" the .tex file.  You will
be provided source code for the solution template which you are required to use.  The source code will be provided as a link to an Overleaf
document and so you may find it preferable to use Overleaf to compose and compile your code than the command line.


Note that any figure files or style file that your code depends on must be in the same directory/folder or uploaded to your project on Overleaf.
